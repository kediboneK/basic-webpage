                            Pretoria, atop Meintjieskop at the northern end of Arcadia, close to historic Church Square and the
                            Voortrekker Monument. The large gardens of the Buildings are nestled between Government Avenue, 
                            Vermeulen Street East, Church Street, the R104 and Blackwood Street. Fairview Avenue is a closed road
                            through which only officials can enter the Union Buildings.</p>
